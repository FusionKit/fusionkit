# FusionKit
a toolkit for handling fusion experimental and simulation data and allows for quickly building complex workflows integrating several simulations codes at once! Current focus of the workflows is generating inputs for and analysing output from gyrokinetics simulations with support for the GENE, QuaLiKiz and TGLF codes. An extensive Equilibrium class with s-alpha and Miller geometry is also included.

## Core Classes
- DataSpine
- Plasma
- Equilibrium
  
## Extensions
- EX2GK
- GENE
- JET_PPF
- TGLF
- QLK
